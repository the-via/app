## Looking for an offline app?
@cebby2420 has kindly made a desktop app that does so. This has no official affiliation with VIA, but you can find it at https://github.com/cebby2420/via-desktop.

## Useful commands
### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:5173 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!


### `npm run format`

Formats the code with prettier.
